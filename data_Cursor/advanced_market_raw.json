          "content": "Defining next-generation operational-risk management\nThe operational-risk discipline needs to evolve in four areas: 1) the mandate needs to expand to include second-line oversight, to support operational excellence and business-process resiliency; 2) analytics-driven issue detection and real-time risk reporting have to replace manual risk assessments; 3) talent needs to be realigned as digitization progresses and data and analytics are rolled out: banks will need specialists to manage specific risk types such as cyberrisk, fraud, and conduct risk; and 4) human-factor risks will have to be monitored and assessed—including those that relate to misconduct (such as sexual harassment) and to diversity and inclusion.\n 3.

While banks have been aware of risks associated with operations or employee activities for a long while, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), in a series of papers published between 1999 and 2001, elevated operational risk to a distinct and controllable risk category requiring its own tools and organization.1The standard Basel Committee on Banking Supervision definition of operational (or nonfinancial) risk is “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. The relationship between operational-risk management and the business can also integrate operational-risk reporting and executive and board reporting—including straight-through processing rates, incidents detected, key risk indicators, and insights from complaints and customer calls.\n At the same time, digitization and automation have been changing the nature of work, reducing traditional human errors but creating new change-management risks; fintech partnerships create cyberrisks and produce new single points of failure; the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) raises issues of decision bias and ethical use of customer data.",
