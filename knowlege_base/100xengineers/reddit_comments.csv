Had asked this question on this subreddit's discord, and they also said that this seems overhyped and is a marketing technique. But I still feels like pursuing if I get a chance, but it is an expensive course.

guys all these comments are from their pr team ignore them and believe me its not worth the price

I did buy and u can text me

I joined in this course as I wanted to learn what's the deal with AI and the Hype around it. They are giving options for coding based and non-coding based GenAi tracks. Even though all this data would be available online theyhave formed a decent structure for someone like me who has zero knowledge of AI and also no experience or talent on coding. I am still 30% into the course and I am very satisfied. I have already learned so many things which I was never aware of.

If u know someone who has bought it or u have bought it yourself. Pls dm

Is anyone doing this course? can you pls share your experience? TIA
