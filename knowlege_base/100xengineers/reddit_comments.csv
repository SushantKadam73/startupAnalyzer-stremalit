"Thoughts on 100x Engineers- Generative AI Wizard CourseI recently came across the Generative AI Wizard Course by 100x Engineers. Would appreciate if someone could advise whether it is worth investing into.

Had asked this question on this subreddit's discord, and they also said that this seems overhyped and is a marketing technique. But I still feels like pursuing if I get a chance, but it is an expensive course.

guys all these comments are from their pr team ignore them and believe me its not worth the price

I did buy and u can text me

I joined in this course as I wanted to learn what's the deal with AI and the Hype around it. They are giving options for coding based and non-coding based GenAi tracks. Even though all this data would be available online theyhave formed a decent structure for someone like me who has zero knowledge of AI and also no experience or talent on coding. I am still 30% into the course and I am very satisfied. I have already learned so many things which I was never aware of.

If u know someone who has bought it or u have bought it yourself. Pls dm

Is anyone doing this course? can you pls share your experience? TIA

"cohort for full stack engineeringwhat do you guys think about this [100xengineers](https://100xengineers.com) cohort?  
This is a 4months long *AI* accelerated full stack engineering cohort.

My story: I am a b.sc maths final year student. I know a bit of basic phython, c, html, css and git.  I have a interest in pursuing data science after graduation. My plan is to acquire relevant skills, engage in open source projects, and explore internship opportunities. But I lack experience in real-life problem-solving using coding, I am contemplating whether I should enroll in a course  to get some experience and learn full stack?

They will be teaching

&#x200B;","Negative.  The comment expresses skepticism and disbelief about the feasibility of learning AI in such a short timeframe.


Positive.  The advice is helpful, practical, and encouraging.


Negative.  The commenter expresses a financial constraint, making the cost prohibitive.


Negative.  The commenter is suggesting alternatives that are likely free or significantly cheaper, implying the 100xEngineers cohort is not a good value.


Positive.  The commenter praises the Odin Project for its self-directed learning approach and its effectiveness in teaching learning methodologies rather than just specific technologies.


Negative.  The commenter is expressing skepticism about the value of the course, suggesting it's focused on superficial learning and discourages independent project-based learning.


Negative.  The commenter is discouraging the user from the proposed course, suggesting they can learn the same material for free/much cheaper elsewhere.
","In 4 months you can learn AI? Wtf

Hello,

First things first - Don't get overwhelmed. It's not as difficult as you might be thinking right now.  My stepwise recommendation is as follows:

**Step 1:** 

Pick one language. Anyone - Java, Python, Golang, Nodejs or any other language that you are comfortable with. (My recommendation is Python, Java)

**Step 2:** 

Learn basic data structures - Maps, list, array, stack, queue. Use anyone of the free websites - [skillcaptain.app](https://skillcaptain.app) (*Disclaimer: I created this one*), [tutorialspoint.com](https://tutorialpoints.com), [baeldung.com](https://baeldung.com)

**Step 3:**

There is no better way to learn coding other than writing code yourself. Solve one easy question from leetcode. EVERYDAY.  Look at the discussion section if you are stuck.

I won't recommend watching youtube tutorials. They are time-consuming and not super effective.

**Step 4:** 

Once you are familiar with smaller codes, try attempting bigger problems - User registration, Product registration, etc. 

You will find resources on [educative.io](https://educative.io), [skillcaptain.app](https://skillcaptain.app) , or just simply google. 

**Step 5:**

Make your own project and take it till deployment on AWS. There are many resources online available for it. Make something like an online diary or a small e-commerce site.

**Step 6:**

Ask for help. Reach out to seniors, your LinkedIn network, or twitter. The community is more than willing to help.

**Step 7:**

Showcase your journey on Medium, and github. Get your resume reviewed. 

**Step 8:**

Add recruiters on your network in LinkedIn. I have heard [naukri.com](https://naukri.com) and instahyre are also good platforms for job search.

**Step 9:**

Focus on today. DON'T GET OVERWHELMED.

Happy Learning! Feel free to dm me if you need any help.

not mentioned in the post, this course will cost 30,000/- rs. I am from a lower middle class family so it is a big sum for me.

There are free alternatives like app academy open and full stack open

I learnt MERN stack through The Odin Project for free. My job is such that I get a lot of free time during my work hours so I managed to complete the entire curriculum in about 7 months. The awesome thing about TOP is teaches you by forcing you to go and read documentation, what this means is by the end of the course whether or not you've learnt MERN stack, you would've definitely learnt how to learn stuff. Which is much better than these paid courses which are mostly glorified tutorials that leave you in a tutorial hell. My recommendation is to go through The Odin Project and once done you can explore what field you're interested in and learn them on your own.

Courses are useless, they teach you Hello world programs for the best part.
You get bored, and when the stage to build project kicks in, you will just copy-paste out of boredom.

Instead, pick a problem you found (even if there is an alternate solution) and try to build a project around it.
You will learn more and then showcase that to get a job.

While building the project, keep a few things in mind,
1. You want to get into an enterprise company, so follow some coding rules that are generally accepted.
2. Build a scalable solution.
3. Think of the product life cycle, from code development to cicd pipelines to deployment.

Don't fall for this. You can learn all this for free from YouTube. If you do prefer professional courses, go for Udemy. They basically have discount 24/7/365 and it'll cost MUCH less than 30k. Personally, I learned all of this (except AI) in around 1k.",posted by:Few_Willow_9950,"[Redditor(name='busyburner'), Redditor(name='puck-akx'), Redditor(name='Few_Willow_9950'), Redditor(name='ahappymaninasuit'), Redditor(name='MugiwaranoAK'), Redditor(name='Rajeshg1992'), Redditor(name='ha9unaka')]"
