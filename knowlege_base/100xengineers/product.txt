100xEngineers is a generative AI engineering course.  It aims to teach practical skills in generative AI through project-based learning, distinguishing itself from courses focusing solely on tools like ChatGPT.  The course covers a range of topics, including generative AI fundamentals, diffusion models (with a focus on Stable Diffusion), prompt engineering, fine-tuning models, model deployment (MLOps), and specific tools and frameworks like PyTorch, Langchain, GitHub, Google Colab, and various AI APIs (OpenAI, DALL-E 3, etc.).  The course also includes instruction on LLMs, AI Agents, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and vector databases.
